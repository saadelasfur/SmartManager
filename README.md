## SmartManagerCN Recovery Flashable ZIP
A simple recovery flashable ZIP to install the Chinese Smart Manager (SmartManagerCN) on your Samsung device with OneUI 6.1/6.1.1 and 7.x

- Data usage tracking, plan addition, and app data usage tracking
- Advanced call and message blocking, and smart blocking
